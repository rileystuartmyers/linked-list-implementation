# linked-list-implementation
Creates a linked list with nodes, and each node having a 'left' and 'right' child, along with a data variable.

Very, VERY basic implementation. It's definitely pretty rough around the edges as this was made when I was first starting to understand linked lists lol. 

Inputs consist of command lines, including 'Insert', 'Remove', and 'Print'. Command lines can be taken out if linked list usage is the only thing needed. 

Output files strictly consist of each data member of the linked list, in order, printed with an endline.

Thank you for reading!
